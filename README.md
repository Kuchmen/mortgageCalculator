The first tab exists for adding and editing bank cards. When adding information about the bank, data is entered that will be saved. You can add, edit and delete information in cards.

By going to the second tab, you can select a bank from the drop-down box and fill in the details of the loan you would like to take (loan amount and term in months). After clicking on the "calculate" button, you will receive information about the initial payment and the amount of the monthly fee for the loan.
